# My C++ learning progress
## 25 spring HKUST

This repository documents my journey learning C++ at HKUST in Spring 2025. 

### My feelings about C++
Learning C++ has been both challenging and rewarding for me. At first, the syntax and concepts like pointers, memory management, and object-oriented programming felt overwhelming. However, as I progressed, I started to appreciate the power and flexibility that C++ offers. Debugging memory issues and understanding how things work under the hood has given me a deeper appreciation for programming in general.

### My perspectives
C++ is a language that really teaches me the fundamentals of computer science. It forces me to think carefully about how my code manages resources and how data is structured. While it can be tough at times, I believe that mastering C++ will make me a better programmer in any language. I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned in future projects and exploring more advanced topics in C++.

1. All the projects that I have done will be published here.
2. Free to copy and learn from.
3. I will stay motivated and keep coding!
