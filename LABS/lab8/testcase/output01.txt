COMP 2211 - Exploring Artificial Intelligence (3 units)
723
This course provides a gentle introduction to artificial intelligence (AI), and emphasizes hands-on practical experiences with Python and AI software tools to explore AI applications. Interesting applications that have been covered in previous class offerings include, but are not limited to, medical diagnosis, predictions of customer behaviour and user attitudes, character recognition, spam mail detection, text and image classifications and recognitions, sentiment analysis, and retinal vessel segmentation. The course also explores recent advances and discusses the history and ethics of AI. Only for students in their first and second year of study or those with approval from instructor by applying requisite waiver.

COMP 2521 - Mobile Application Development Projects (3 units)
606
This course is intended to bring together students from different disciplines to focus on coming up with innovative mobile solutions to address domain-specific problems. This will be a student-led project-based course. Teams of students will focus on developing applications to address the needs of specific application domains. Learning additional technical knowledge will be demand-driven in self-learning mode. Students will be supported by technical advisors, which include a faculty member who is the main instructor, as well as instructional assistant(s) and student helpers with technical knowledge.
