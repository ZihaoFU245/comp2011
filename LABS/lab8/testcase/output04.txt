Category theory
83
Category theory is a general theory of mathematical structures and their relations.
8
Morphism
225
A morphism is a concept of category theory that generalizes structure-preserving maps such as homomorphism between algebraic structures, functions from a set to another set, and continuous functions between topological spaces
7
Functor
42
A functor is a mapping between categories.
8
Category
151
A category (sometimes called an abstract category to distinguish it from a concrete category) is a collection of "objects" that are linked by "arrows".
16
Category of sets
219
The category of sets, denoted by Set, is the category whose objects are sets. The arrows or morphisms between sets A and B are the functions from A to B, and the composition of morphisms is the composition of functions.
